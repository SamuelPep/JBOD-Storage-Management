JBOD Networking Client 

Submitted by: Samuel Peprah Millner

JBOD Networking Client is a C-based client-side implementation of a custom network protocol that communicates with a JBOD (Just a Bunch Of Disks) server. It builds and sends structured packets to simulate remote disk operations over a TCP/IP socket connection.

Time spent: ~8â€“10 hours total (design, implementation, and debugging)

âœ… Required Features

The following required functionality was implemented and tested:
	â€¢	jbod_connect() establishes a TCP socket connection to the JBOD server.
	â€¢	jbod_disconnect() cleanly closes the connection.
	â€¢	send_packet() wraps opcode + block into a 261-byte network packet and sends it to the server.
	â€¢	recv_packet() receives a response and extracts the return code and block (if present).
	â€¢	jbod_client_operation() replaces local jbod_operation() and handles full request-response exchange.
	â€¢	Able to pass all trace file tests (simple-input, random-input, linear-input) with correct output.

ðŸ”§ Technical Overview

This project extended an existing storage emulator by enabling network-based disk communication using a custom protocol. A full packet consists of:
	â€¢	4 bytes â€” Opcode
	â€¢	1 byte â€” Info code (bit flags: return value + block presence)
	â€¢	256 bytes â€” Data block payload (optional)

The client performs the following steps per request:
	1.	Builds a packet_t struct in memory (with optional block data).
	2.	Sends the packet using nwrite().
	3.	Waits for and reads a full 261-byte response using nread().
	4.	Extracts the return value and optionally the data block into a buffer.

ðŸ’¡ Key Concepts Practiced
	â€¢	C socket programming (TCP connect, send, receive)
	â€¢	Byte-level data structuring (serialization/deserialization)
	â€¢	Bitwise flag manipulation
	â€¢	Replacing function calls with network logic (jbod_operation â†’ jbod_client_operation)
	â€¢	Pointer-based memory handling with malloc, memcpy

ðŸ§  Notes

Challenges Faced:
	â€¢	Understanding why a 261-byte packet structure was required and how to build it correctly.
	â€¢	Correctly managing pointer arithmetic and memory allocation (especially when casting uint8_t*).
	â€¢	Learning how to use bitwise operations to pack and unpack the info_code byte.
	â€¢	Ensuring reliable transmission and reception of data over sockets using nwrite() and nread().

ðŸ§ª Testing

Testing was performed by running the JBOD server (./jbod_server -v) and then executing the tester with different trace files. Output was verified using:
